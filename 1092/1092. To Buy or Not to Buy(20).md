# 1092 To Buy or Not to Buy (20 分)

Eva would like to make a string of beads with her favorite colors so she went to a small shop to buy some beads. There were many colorful strings of beads. However the owner of the shop would only sell the strings in whole pieces. Hence Eva must check whether a string in the shop contains all the beads she needs. She now comes to you for help: if the answer is `Yes`, please tell her the number of extra beads she has to buy; or if the answer is `No`, please tell her the number of beads missing from the string.

伊娃想用她最喜欢的颜色做一串珠子，所以她去一家小商店买了一些珠子。有许多五颜六色的串珠。然而，店主只出售整条绳子。因此，伊娃必须检查店里的一根绳子上是否有她需要的所有珠子。现在她来找你帮忙:如果答案是“是”，请告诉她需要额外买多少珠子;如果答案是“否”，请告诉她绳子上少了多少珠子。

For the sake of simplicity, let's use the characters in the ranges [0-9], [a-z], and [A-Z] to represent the colors. For example, the 3rd string in Figure 1 is the one that Eva would like to make. Then the 1st string is okay since it contains all the necessary beads with 8 extra ones; yet the 2nd one is not since there is no black bead and one less red bead.

为了简单起见，让我们使用[0-9]、[a-z]和[A-Z]范围内的字符来表示颜色。例如，图1中的第三个绳子是Eva想要创建的。然后第一个绳子是好的，因为它包含了所有必要的珠子和8个额外的;但第二颗没有，因为没有黑珠，且少了一颗红珠。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case gives in two lines the strings of no more than 1000 beads which belong to the shop owner and Eva, respectively.

每个输入文件包含一个测试用例。每个例子分成两行，分别是店主和伊娃的不超过1000颗的串珠。

## Output Specification:

For each test case, print your answer in one line. If the answer is `Yes`, then also output the number of extra beads Eva has to buy; or if the answer is `No`, then also output the number of beads missing from the string. There must be exactly 1 space between the answer and the number.

对于每个测试用例，在一行中打印您的答案。如果答案是“是”，那么也输出Eva需要购买的额外珠子的数量;或者如果答案是“否”，那么也输出从绳子中丢失的珠子的数量。答案和数字之间必须有1个空格。
