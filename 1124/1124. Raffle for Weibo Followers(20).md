# 1124 Raffle for Weibo Followers (20 分)

John got a full mark on PAT. He was so happy that he decided to hold a raffle（抽奖） for his followers on Weibo -- that is, he would select winners from every N followers who forwarded his post, and give away gifts. Now you are supposed to help him generate the list of winners.

约翰在PAT得了满分他非常高兴，他决定在微博上为他的粉丝们举行抽奖活动，即他从每个转发他帖子的N个关注者中选出优胜者，并赠送礼物。现在你应该帮助他生成获奖者名单。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integers M (≤ 1000), N and S, being the total number of forwards, the skip number of winners, and the index of the first winner (the indices start from 1). Then M lines follow, each gives the nickname (a nonempty string of no more than 20 characters, with no white space or return) of a follower who has forwarded John's post.

Note: it is possible that someone would forward more than once, but no one can win more than once. Hence if the current candidate of a winner has won before, we must skip him/her and consider the next one.

每个输入文件包含一个测试案例。对于每个案例，第一行给出三个正整数 M（≤ 1000），N 和 S，分别是转发总数、中奖者跳过数和第一个赢家的索引（指数从 1 开始）。然后M行跟随，每个给一个绰号（一个非空的字符串不超过20个字符，没有空格或返回）转发约翰帖子的粉丝。

注意：有人可能会转发不止一次，但没有人能赢得不止一次。因此，如果目前获胜的候选人已经获胜，我们必须跳过他/她，考虑下一个。

## Output Specification:

For each case, print the list of winners in the same order as in the input, each nickname occupies a line. If there is no winner yet, print `Keep going...` instead.

对于每个案例，以与输入相同的顺序打印获奖者名单，每个昵称占据一行。如果没有赢家， 请打印 "继续..." 。
