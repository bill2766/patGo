# 1048 Find Coins (25 分)

Eva loves to collect coins from all over the universe, including some other planets like Mars. One day she visited a universal shopping mall which could accept all kinds of coins as payments. However, there was a special requirement of the payment: for each bill, she could only use exactly two coins to pay the exact amount. Since she has as many as 10^5^ coins with her, she definitely needs your help. You are supposed to tell her, for any given amount of money, whether or not she can find two coins to pay for it.

伊娃喜欢从宇宙中收集硬币，包括火星等其他行星。一天，她参观了一家宇宙购物中心，可以接受各种硬币作为付款。然而，付款有一个特殊要求：对于每张钞票，她只能使用正好两枚硬币来支付确切的金额。由于她有多达10^5^硬币，她肯定需要你的帮助。你应该告诉她，对于任何给定数额的钱，她是否能找到两枚硬币来支付。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive numbers: *N* (≤10^5^, the total number of coins) and *M* (≤10^3^, the amount of money Eva has to pay). The second line contains *N* face values of the coins, which are all positive numbers no more than 500. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

每个输入文件包含一个测试案例。对于每个案例，第一行包含 2 个正数：*N* （≤10^5^，硬币总数）和 *M* （≤10^3^，伊娃必须支付的金额）。第二行包含硬币的 *N* 面值，这些面值均为正数，不超过 500。行中的所有数字都由空间分隔。

## Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the two face values *V*1 and *V*2 (separated by a space) such that *V*1+*V*2=*M* and *V*1≤*V*2. If such a solution is not unique, output the one with the smallest *V*1. If there is no solution, output `No Solution` instead.

对于每个测试案例，将两个面值 *V*1 和 *V*2（按空格分离）打印在一行中，以便 *V*1+V*2*=*M* 和 *V*1≤*V*2。如果这种解决方案并非唯一，则用最小的 *V*1 输出该解决方案。如果没有解决方案，则输出"无解决方案"。
