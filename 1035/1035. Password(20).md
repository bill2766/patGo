# 1035 Password (20 分)

To prepare for PAT, the judge sometimes has to generate random passwords for the users. The problem is that there are always some confusing passwords since it is hard to distinguish `1` (one) from `l` (`L` in lowercase), or `0` (zero) from `O` (`o` in uppercase). One solution is to replace `1` (one) by `@`, `0` (zero) by `%`, `l` by `L`, and `O` by `o`. Now it is your job to write a program to check the accounts generated by the judge, and to help the juge modify the confusing passwords.

为了准备 PAT，法官有时必须为用户生成随机密码。问题是，总是有一些令人困惑的密码，因为很难区分"1"（一）和"l"（"L"在小写），或"0"（零）与"O"（"o"在上壳）。一种解决方案是将"1"（一）替换为"@"，"0"（零）替换为"%"，"l"替换为"L"，将"O"替换为"o"。现在，您的工作是编写一个程序来检查法官生成的帐户，并帮助法官修改混乱的密码。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a positive integer *N* (≤1000), followed by *N* lines of accounts. Each account consists of a user name and a password, both are strings of no more than 10 characters with no space.

每个输入文件包含一个测试案例。每个案例都包含正整数 *N* （≤1000），然后是 *N* 帐户行。每个帐户由用户名和密码组成，两者都是不超过 10 个字符的字符串，没有空间。

## Output Specification:

For each test case, first print the number *M* of accounts that have been modified, then print in the following *M* lines the modified accounts info, that is, the user names and the corresponding modified passwords. The accounts must be printed in the same order as they are read in. If no account is modified, print in one line `There are N accounts and no account is modified` where `N` is the total number of accounts. However, if `N` is one, you must print `There is 1 account and no account is modified` instead.

对于每个测试案例，首先打印已修改的帐户的编号 *M*，然后在以下 *M* 行中打印修改后的帐户信息，即用户名和相应的修改密码。帐户必须按相同的顺序打印，以便阅读。如果没有修改帐户，则打印在一行"有 N 帐户，没有帐户被修改"中，其中"N"是帐户总数。但是，如果"N"是一个帐户，则必须打印"有 1 个帐户，并且没有修改任何帐户"。

## Sample Input 1:

```cpp

```

## Sample Output 1:

```cpp
2
Team000002 RLsp%dfa
Team000001 R@spodfa
结尾无空行
```

## Sample Input 2:

```cpp
1
team110 abcdefg332
结尾无空行
```

## Sample Output 2:

```cpp

结尾无空行
```

## Sample Input 3:

```cpp
2
team110 abcdefg222
team220 abcdefg333
结尾无空行
```

## Sample Output 3:

```cpp

结尾无空行
```
