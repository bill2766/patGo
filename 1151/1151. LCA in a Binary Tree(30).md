# 1151 LCA in a Binary Tree (30 分)

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes U and V in a tree is the deepest node that has both U and V as descendants.

Given any two nodes in a binary tree, you are supposed to find their LCA.

树中两个节点U和V的最低共同祖先(LCA)是同时拥有U和V作为后代的最深的节点。

给定二叉树中的任意两个节点，您应该找到它们的LCA。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers: M (≤ 1,000), the number of pairs of nodes to be tested; and N (≤ 10,000), the number of keys in the binary tree, respectively. In each of the following two lines, N distinct integers are given as the inorder and preorder traversal sequences of the binary tree, respectively. It is guaranteed that the binary tree can be uniquely determined by the input sequences. Then M lines follow, each contains a pair of integer keys U and V. All the keys are in the range of **int**.

每个输入文件包含一个测试用例。对于每种情况，第一行给出两个正整数:M(≤1,000)，待测试节点对的数量;二叉树中键的个数N(≤10,000)。在下面的两行中，分别给出了N个不同的整数作为二叉树的中序和前序遍历序列。它保证了二叉树可以由输入序列唯一确定。接下来是M行，每一行包含一对整数键U和v。所有的键都在**int**范围内。

## Output Specification:

For each given pair of U and V, print in a line `LCA of U and V is A.` if the LCA is found and `A` is the key. But if `A` is one of U and V, print `X is an ancestor of Y.` where `X` is `A` and `Y` is the other node. If U or V is not found in the binary tree, print in a line `ERROR: U is not found.` or `ERROR: V is not found.` or `ERROR: U and V are not found.`.

对于每一对给定的U和V，在一行中打印' LCA of U和V is a。，如果找到LCA，并且“A”是键。但如果“A”是U和V中的一个，则打印“X是Y的祖先”。'，其中' X '是' A '， ' Y '是另一个节点。如果在二叉树中没有找到U或V，打印一行' ERROR: U is not found。'或'错误:V未找到。'或'错误:U和V未找到。'。

## Sample Input:

```cpp
6 8
7 2 3 4 6 5 1 8
5 3 7 2 6 4 8 1
2 6
8 1
7 9
12 -3
0 8
99 99
结尾无空行
```

## Sample Output:

```cpp
LCA of 2 and 6 is 3.
8 is an ancestor of 1.
ERROR: 9 is not found.
ERROR: 12 and -3 are not found.
ERROR: 0 is not found.
ERROR: 99 and 99 are not found.
结尾无空行
```

# 感悟

**知识点：**

- 可以用递归的写法，用cnt记录数目

**注意点：**
