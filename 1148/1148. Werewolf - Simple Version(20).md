# 1148 Werewolf - Simple Version (20 分)

Werewolf（狼人杀） is a game in which the players are partitioned into two parties: the werewolves and the human beings. Suppose that in a game,

- player #1 said: "Player #2 is a werewolf.";
- player #2 said: "Player #3 is a human.";
- player #3 said: "Player #4 is a werewolf.";
- player #4 said: "Player #5 is a human."; and
- player #5 said: "Player #4 is a human.".

Given that there were 2 werewolves among them, at least one but not all the werewolves were lying, and there were exactly 2 liars. Can you point out the werewolves?

Now you are asked to solve a harder version of this problem: given that there were *N* players, with 2 werewolves among them, at least one but not all the werewolves were lying, and there were exactly 2 liars. You are supposed to point out the werewolves.

狼人杀是一个游戏，玩家被分成两个方：狼人和人类。假设在游戏中，

- 玩家#1说： "玩家#2是狼人。
- 玩家#2说："玩家#3是人。
- 玩家#3说： "玩家#4是狼人。
- 玩家#4说："玩家#5是人。
- 玩家#5说： "玩家#4是人。

鉴于其中有2个狼人，至少有一个，但不是所有的狼人都在撒谎，而且正好有2个骗子。你能指出狼人吗？

现在，你被要求解决这个问题的一个更困难的说法：鉴于有*N*玩家，其中有2个狼人，至少一个，但不是所有的狼都在撒谎，而且正好有2个骗子。你应该指出狼人。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer *N* (5≤*N*≤100). Then *N* lines follow and the *i*-th line gives the statement of the *i*-th player (1≤*i*≤*N*), which is represented by the index of the player with a positive sign for a human and a negative sign for a werewolf.

每个输入文件包含一个测试案例。对于每个案例，第一行给出一个正整数 *N* （5≤*N*≤100）。然后*N* 条跟随，第*i*行给出对第*i*个玩家（1≤*i*≤*N*）的陈述，该语句由人类正号和狼人负号表示。

## Output Specification:

If a solution exists, print in a line in ascending order the indices of the two werewolves. The numbers must be separated by exactly one space with no extra spaces at the beginning or the end of the line. If there are more than one solution, you must output the smallest solution sequence -- that is, for two sequences *A*=*a*[1],...,*a*[*M*] and *B*=*b*[1],...,*b*[*M*], if there exists 0≤*k*<*M* such that *a*[*i*]=*b*[*i*] (*i*≤*k*) and *a*[*k*+1]<*b*[*k*+1], then *A* is said to be smaller than *B*. In case there is no solution, simply print `No Solution`.

如果存在解决方案，则按上升顺序打印两个狼的下标。数字必须完全由一个空格分开，在行的开头或末端没有额外的空格。如果有多个解决方案，则必须输出最小的解决方案序列 - 即对于两个序列*A*=*a*[1],...,*a*[*M*]和B*=*b*[1],...,*b[*M*] 如果存在 0≤k<M 使得a[i]=b[i] (i≤k)且a[k+1]<b[k+1]，则*A*小于*B*。如果没有解决方案，只需打印"No Solution"。

## Sample Input 1:

```cpp
5
-2
+3
-4
+5
+4
结尾无空行
```

## Sample Output 1:

```cpp
1 4

```

## Sample Output 2 (the solution is not unique):

```cpp
1 5
结尾无空行
```

## Sample Input 3:

```cpp
5

-3
-4
-5
-1
结尾无空行
