# 1062 Talent and Virtue (25 分)

About 900 years ago, a Chinese philosopher Sima Guang wrote a history book in which he talked about people's talent and virtue. According to his theory, a man being outstanding in both talent and virtue must be a "sage（圣人）"; being less excellent but with one's virtue outweighs talent can be called a "nobleman（君子）"; being good in neither is a "fool man（愚人）"; yet a fool man is better than a "small man（小人）" who prefers talent than virtue.

Now given the grades of talent and virtue of a group of people, you are supposed to rank them according to Sima Guang's theory.

大约900年前，中国哲学家司马光写了一本历史书，里面谈到了人的才能和美德。根据他的理论,一个人的优秀人才和美德必须是“圣人”;才能不太好但是美德可以被称为“君子”;两个都不好是一个“愚人”;但是愚人比“小人”好，小人是更喜欢才能相较于美德。

现在，你要根据司马光的理论，给一群人的才能和德行打分。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case first gives 3 positive integers in a line: *N* (≤105), the total number of people to be ranked; *L* (≥60), the lower bound of the qualified grades -- that is, only the ones whose grades of talent and virtue are both not below this line will be ranked; and *H* (<100), the higher line of qualification -- that is, those with both grades not below this line are considered as the "sages", and will be ranked in non-increasing order according to their total grades. Those with talent grades below *H* but virtue grades not are cosidered as the "noblemen", and are also ranked in non-increasing order according to their total grades, but they are listed after the "sages". Those with both grades below *H*, but with virtue not lower than talent are considered as the "fool men". They are ranked in the same way but after the "noblemen". The rest of people whose grades both pass the *L* line are ranked after the "fool men".

每个输入文件包含一个测试用例。每一种情况首先给出3个正整数排成一行:*N*(≤105)，要排名的总人数;*L*(≥60)为合格等级的下界，即只有天赋和美德的等级不低于这条线的人才会被排名;*H*(<100)，即两个成绩均不低于这条线者为“圣人”，并根据其总成绩不递增排序。那些天赋等级低于*H*而美德等级不高于*H*的人被认为是“君子”，也按照他们的总等级不递增的顺序排列，但他们被列在“圣人”之后。两个等级都在*H*以下，但德性不低于才能的人被认为是“愚人”。他们的排名是一样的，但排在“君子”之后。其余成绩都达到L* *线的人则排在“愚人”之后。

Then *N* lines follow, each gives the information of a person in the format:

接下来是*N*行，每一行都是一个人的信息，格式如下:

```
ID_Number Virtue_Grade Talent_Grade
```

where `ID_Number` is an 8-digit number, and both grades are integers in [0, 100]. All the numbers are separated by a space.

其中' ID_Number '是一个8位数字，两个等级都是[0,100]中的整数。所有的数字都用一个空格隔开。

## Output Specification:

The first line of output must give *M* (≤*N*), the total number of people that are actually ranked. Then *M* lines follow, each gives the information of a person in the same format as the input, according to the ranking rules. If there is a tie of the total grade, they must be ranked with respect to their virtue grades in non-increasing order. If there is still a tie, then output in increasing order of their ID's.

输出的第一行必须给出*M*(≤*N*)，即实际排名的总人数。接下来是*M*行，每一行根据排名规则，以与输入相同的格式给出一个人的信息。如果总等级相等，则必须按照美德等级不递增的顺序进行排名。如果仍有平局，则按其ID的递增顺序输出。

## Sample Input:

```cpp
14 60 80
10000001 64 90
10000002 90 60
10000011 85 80
10000003 85 80
10000004 80 85
10000005 82 77
10000006 83 76
10000007 90 78
10000008 75 79
10000009 59 90
10000010 88 45
10000012 80 100
10000013 90 99
10000014 66 60
结尾无空行
```

## Sample Output:

```cpp
12
10000013 90 99
10000012 80 100
10000003 85 80
10000011 85 80
10000004 80 85
10000007 90 78
10000006 83 76
10000005 82 77
10000002 90 60
10000014 66 60
10000008 75 79
10000001 64 90
