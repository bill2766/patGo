# 1003 Emergency (25 分)

As an emergency rescue team leader of a city, you are given a special map of your country. The map shows several scattered cities connected by some roads. Amount of rescue teams in each city and the length of each road between any pair of cities are marked on the map. When there is an emergency call to you from some other city, your job is to lead your men to the place as quickly as possible, and at the mean time, call up as many hands on the way as possible.

作为城市的紧急救援队队长，您将获得一张您所在国家/地区的特殊地图。地图显示了由一些道路连接的几个分散的城市。地图上标出了每个城市的救援队数量以及任何一对城市之间的每条道路的长度。当其他城市有紧急电话给你时，你的工作是尽快带领你的人到达那个地方，同时尽可能多地在路上打电话。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each test case, the first line contains 4 positive integers: *N* (≤500) - the number of cities (and the cities are numbered from 0 to *N*−1), *M* - the number of roads, *C*1 and *C*2 - the cities that you are currently in and that you must save, respectively. The next line contains *N* integers, where the *i*-th integer is the number of rescue teams in the *i*-th city. Then *M* lines follow, each describes a road with three integers *c*1, *c*2 and *L*, which are the pair of cities connected by a road and the length of that road, respectively. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one path from *C*1 to *C*2.

每个输入文件包含一个测试用例。对于每个测试用例，第一行包含 4 个正整数：*N* (≤500) - 城市数量（城市编号从 0 到 *N*−1），*M* - 道路数量， *C*1 和 *C*2 - 分别是您当前所在和必须保存的城市。下一行包含 *N* 个整数，其中第 *i* 个整数是第 *i* 个城市中救援队的数量。然后 *M* 行，每行用三个整数 *c*1、*c*2 和 *L* 描述一条道路，它们分别是由一条道路连接的城市对和这条道路的长度。保证至少存在一条从*C*1到*C*2的路径。

## Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line two numbers: the number of different shortest paths between *C*1 and *C*2, and the maximum amount of rescue teams you can possibly gather. All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there is no extra space allowed at the end of a line.

对于每个测试用例，在一行中打印两个数字：*C*1 和 *C*2 之间不同的最短路径的数量，以及您可能收集的最大救援队数量。一行中的所有数字必须正好用一个空格隔开，并且行尾不允许有多余的空格。

## Sample Input:

```cpp
5 6 0 2
1 2 1 5 3
0 1 1
0 2 2
0 3 1
1 2 1
2 4 1
3 4 1
结尾无空行
```

## Sample Output:

```cpp
2 4
结尾无空行
```
