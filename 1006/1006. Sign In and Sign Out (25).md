# 1006 Sign In and Sign Out (25 分)

At the beginning of every day, the first person who signs in the computer room will unlock the door, and the last one who signs out will lock the door. Given the records of signing in's and out's, you are supposed to find the ones who have unlocked and locked the door on that day.

每天开始，第一个签入机房的人会开门，最后一个签出的人会锁门。有了签入、签出的记录，你应该找到当天开锁和锁门的人。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains the records for one day. The case starts with a positive integer *M*, which is the total number of records, followed by *M* lines, each in the format:

每个输入文件包含一个测试用例。每个案例包含一天的记录。 case 以正整数 *M* 开头，它是记录的总数，后跟 *M* 行，每行格式为：

```cpp
ID_number Sign_in_time Sign_out_time
```

where times are given in the format `HH:MM:SS`, and `ID_number` is a string with no more than 15 characters.

其中时间以 `HH:MM:SS` 格式给出，`ID_number` 是一个不超过 15 个字符的字符串。

## Output Specification:

For each test case, output in one line the ID numbers of the persons who have unlocked and locked the door on that day. The two ID numbers must be separated by one space.

Note: It is guaranteed that the records are consistent. That is, the sign in time must be earlier than the sign out time for each person, and there are no two persons sign in or out at the same moment.

对于每个测试用例，一行输出当天开锁和锁门的人的身份证号码。两个 ID 号必须用一个空格隔开。

注：保证记录一致。即每个人的签入时间必须早于签出时间，并且不能有两个人同时签到或签出。

## Sample Input:

```cpp
