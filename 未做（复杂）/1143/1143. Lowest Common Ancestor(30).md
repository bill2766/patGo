# 1143 Lowest Common Ancestor (30 分)

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes U and V in a tree is the deepest node that has both U and V as descendants.

A binary search tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Given any two nodes in a BST, you are supposed to find their LCA.

树中两个节点U和V的最低共同祖先(LCA)是同时拥有U和V作为后代的最深的节点。

二叉搜索树递归定义为具有以下性质的二叉树:

—节点的左子树只包含键值小于该节点键值的节点。
—节点的右子树只包含键值大于或等于该节点键值的节点。
—左子树和右子树都必须是二叉搜索树。

给定BST中的任意两个节点，您应该找到它们的LCA。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers: M (≤ 1,000), the number of pairs of nodes to be tested; and N (≤ 10,000), the number of keys in the BST, respectively. In the second line, N distinct integers are given as the preorder traversal sequence of the BST. Then M lines follow, each contains a pair of integer keys U and V. All the keys are in the range of **int**.

每个输入文件包含一个测试用例。对于每种情况，第一行给出两个正整数:M(≤1,000)，待测试节点对的数量;BST中键的个数N(≤10,000)。在第二行中，给出N个不同的整数作为BST的前序遍历序列。接下来是M行，每一行包含一对整数键U和v。所有的键都在**int**范围内。

## Output Specification:

For each given pair of U and V, print in a line `LCA of U and V is A.` if the LCA is found and `A` is the key. But if `A` is one of U and V, print `X is an ancestor of Y.` where `X` is `A` and `Y` is the other node. If U or V is not found in the BST, print in a line `ERROR: U is not found.` or `ERROR: V is not found.` or `ERROR: U and V are not found.`.

对于每一对给定的U和V，在一行中打印' LCA of U和V is a。，如果找到LCA，并且“A”是键。但如果“A”是U和V中的一个，则打印“X是Y的祖先”。'，其中' X '是' A '， ' Y '是另一个节点。如果在BST中没有找到U或V，在一行中打印' ERROR: U is not found. ''或'错误:V未找到。'或'错误:U和V未找到。'。

## Sample Input:

```cpp
6 8
6 3 1 2 5 4 8 7
2 5
8 7
1 9
12 -3
0 8
99 99
结尾无空行
```

## Sample Output:

```cpp
LCA of 2 and 5 is 3.
8 is an ancestor of 7.
ERROR: 9 is not found.
ERROR: 12 and -3 are not found.
ERROR: 0 is not found.
ERROR: 99 and 99 are not found.
结尾无空行
```
