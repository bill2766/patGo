# 1084 Broken Keyboard (20 分)

On a broken keyboard, some of the keys are worn out. So when you type some sentences, the characters corresponding to those keys will not appear on screen.

Now given a string that you are supposed to type, and the string that you actually type out, please list those keys which are for sure worn out.

在一个坏掉的键盘上，有些键已经磨损了。所以当你输入一些句子时，与这些键对应的字符将不会出现在屏幕上。

现在，给定一个你要输入的字符串，以及你实际输入的字符串，请列出那些肯定已经坏掉的键。

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the 1st line contains the original string, and the 2nd line contains the typed-out string. Each string contains no more than 80 characters which are either English letters [A-Z] (case insensitive), digital numbers [0-9], or `_` (representing the space). It is guaranteed that both strings are non-empty.

每个输入文件包含一个测试用例。对于每种情况，第一行包含原始字符串，第二行包含打印出来的字符串。每个字符串不超过80个字符，包含英文字母\[A-Z](不区分大小写)、数字数字[0-9]或' _ '(表示空格)。它保证两个字符串都是非空的。

## Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the keys that are worn out, in the order of being detected. The English letters must be capitalized. Each worn out key must be printed once only. It is guaranteed that there is at least one worn out key.

对于每个测试用例，按照被检测到的顺序，在一行中打印出被磨损的键。英文字母必须大写。每个破损的键只能打印一次。保证至少有一把键磨损。

## Sample Input:

```cpp
7_This_is_a_test
_hs_s_a_es
结尾无空行
```

## Sample Output:

```cpp
7TI
结尾无空行
```
